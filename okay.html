   <p>  I have something to tell you: I like you. I've always liked you since the first time we met. Yes, it sounds cringe, but it's the truth. It's okay if our emotions don't match; I'm just here to reveal the secret I've been keeping. It's all your fault that I'm interested in everything about you. I hate you for being kind when I need you and for being sweet whenever I felt like I was nothing, which caused me to fall. But it still feels good, nvm, I'm not really asking you, so don't answer it. I also want you to look after yourself. I will always be your number one fan, secretly rooting for you. Don't underestimate yourself; all of your decisions are correct. Finally, I adore you. I apologize for wasting your time.<br> <br>  </p>
